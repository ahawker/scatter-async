# scatter_async

scatter_async is a [Scatter](https://github.com/scatter/scatter) extension which implements
core components for adding third party asynchronous library support.

## Goals

scatter_async is meant to contain generic asynchronous components which can easily be extended by
any of the many asynchronous libraries available in the Python ecosystem. Integrating threading,
multiprocessing, or greenlet based programming shouldn't require heroic effort.

## Status

Under serious, backwards compatibility breaking changes. Use at your own risk.
